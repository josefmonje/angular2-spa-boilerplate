      <p>I'm a bit old-school when it comes to javascript so my only cli command is just <span>npm install</span> and my JavaScript is just JavaScript. I don't have anything running on the background. Don't judge me. :D</p>

      <p>Built while just starting to learn Angular 2, I needed something that can be used as boilerplate for a single page app, something that my team can easily use. This can serve as boilerplate for a small to medium-sized single-page app with minimal modifications.</p>

        <p>If you're a designer, you can skip all the javascript files. It's supposed to take care of itself. Just familiarize yourself with the structure.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you're a developer, this boilerplate automates some things for you. All you have to do is copy/paste a component folder and focus on building your component.</p>

        <p>This is our single-page app. It's a typical Angular 2 component. The JS, HTML, and optional CSS are in this folder together with some Angular 2 boilerplate. This is how we'll organize it.</p>

        <p>A custom pipe. Pipes are just filters from Angular 1. This is a simple example used throughout our app to capitalize the first letter.</p>

        <p>Let's put components in their own subfolder inside app/. Things for this component belong in here, otherwise they go in utils/ like our custom pipe. Copy/paste this folder and change the componentName and name constant inside the script for a new component. Use lowercase for file names.</p>

      <p>That's it! We'll see how it works in the next section.</p>
